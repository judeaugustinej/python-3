#What is JSON ??

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange(method that provides standards for exchanging data) format.
It is easy for humans to read and write.
It is easy for machines to parse and generate.

#Example

``` python
jude = '{'name':'jude job',
         'age': 25,
         'gender':'male'
         }'
```

#Why  JSON?

JSON allows us to overcome the cross-domain
