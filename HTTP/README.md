HTTP is based on a request and a response.

HTTP is a text based protocol

The “verbs” built into the http protocol (GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) map directly to application-level operations for retrieving, creating, modifying, and deleting data

HTTP responses have a status code

| Status Code   | Action             | 
| ------------- |:------------------:| 
| 200           | OK(all is well)    | 
| 301           | Permanant redirect |  
| 302           | Temporary redirect |
| 304           | Data not changed   |
